The neutrons that then emerged from the nucleus simply didn&rsquo;t have enough energy to keep things going. (It was like trying to make wet wood catch fire.)</p><p>But what about uranium fission? Uranium fission was initiated by slow neutrons. What if uranium fission also produced neutrons as well as being initiated by a neutron? Would not the neutrons produced serve to initiate new 129 fissions that would produce new neutrons and so on endlessly?</p><p>It seemed very likely that fission produced neutrons and indeed, Fermi, at the conference where fission was first discussed, suggested it at once. Massive nuclei possessed more neutrons per proton than less massive ones did.</p></div> </div>
