<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A gram of hydrogen, undergoing fusion to helium, would deliver some fifteen times as much energy as a gram of uranium undergoing fission.</p><p>As early as 1920, the English astronomer Arthur Stanley Eddington (1882-1944) had speculated that the sun&rsquo;s energy might be derived from the interaction of subatomic particles. Some sort of nuclear reaction seemed, by then, to be the most reasonable way of accounting for the vast energies constantly being produced by the sun.</p><p>The speculation became more plausible with each year. Eddington himself studied the structure of stars, and by 1926 had produced convincing theoretical reasons for supposing that the center of the sun was at enormous densities and temperatures. A temperature of some 15,000,000 to 20,000,000&deg;C seemed to characterize the sun&rsquo;s center.</p></div> </div>
