Eventually, such devices were built and called &ldquo;stellarators&rdquo; from the Latin word for &ldquo;star&rdquo;, because it was hoped that it would produce the conditions that would allow the sort of fusion reactions that went on in stars.</p><p>All through the 1950s and 1960s, physicists have been slowly inching toward their goal, reaching higher and higher temperatures and holding them for longer and longer periods in denser and denser gases.</p><p>In 1969 the Soviet Union used a device called &ldquo;Tokamak-3&rdquo; (a Russian abbreviation for their phrase for &ldquo;electric-magnetic&rdquo;) to keep a supply of hydrogen-2, a millionth as dense as air, in place while heating it to tens of millions of degrees for a hundredth of a second.</p></div> </div>
