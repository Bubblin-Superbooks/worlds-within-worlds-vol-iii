<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Using the Bevatron in 1956, Segr&egrave; (the discoverer of technetium who had, by that time, emigrated to the United States), the American physicist Owen Chamberlain (1920- ), and others succeeded in detecting the antiproton.</p><p>The antiproton was as unlikely to last as long as the positron was. It was surrounded by myriads of proton-containing nuclei and in a tiny fraction of a second it would encounter one. The antiproton and the proton also underwent mutual annihilation, but having 1836 times the mass, they produced 1836 times the energy that was produced in the case of an electron and a positron.</p><p>There was even an &ldquo;antineutron&rdquo;, a particle reported in 1956 by the Italian-American physicist Oreste Piccioni 162 (1915- ) and his co-workers. Since the neutron has no charge, the antineutron has no charge either, and one might wonder how the antineutron would differ from the neutron then.</p></div> </div>
