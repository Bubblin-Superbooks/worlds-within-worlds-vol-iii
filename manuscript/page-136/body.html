This phenomenon, called &ldquo;pair production&rdquo;, was observed as early as 1930 but was only properly understood after the discovery of the positron.)</p><p>Of course, the mass of electrons and positrons is very small and the amount of energy released per electron is not enormously high. Still, Dirac&rsquo;s original theory of antiparticles was not confined to electrons. By his theory, any particle ought to have some corresponding antiparticle. Corresponding to the proton, for instance, there ought to be an &ldquo;antiproton&rdquo;. This would be just as massive as the proton and would carry a negative charge just as large as the proton&rsquo;s positive charge.</p></div> </div>
