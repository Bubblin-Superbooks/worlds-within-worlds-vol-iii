<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Without a huge gravitational force we cannot simultaneously bring about sun-center densities and sun-center temperatures; one or the other must go.</p><p>On the whole, it would take much less energy to aim at the temperatures than at the densities and would be much more feasible. For this reason, physicists have been attempting, all through the nuclear age, to heat thin wisps of hydrogen to enormous temperature. Since the gas is thin, the nuclei are farther apart and collide with each other far fewer times per second. To achieve fusion ignition, therefore, temperatures must be considerably higher than those at the center of the sun. In 1944 Fermi calculated that it might take a temperature of 50,000,000&deg; to ignite a hydrogen-3 fusion with hydrogen-2 under earthly conditions, and 400,000,000&deg; to ignite hydrogen-2 fusion alone.</p></div> </div>
