In the early 1930s, there were still 2 elements with fairly low atomic numbers that had never been discovered. These were the elements with atomic numbers 43 and 61.</p><p>In 1937, though, molybdenum (atomic number 42) had been bombarded with neutrons in Lawrence&rsquo;s laboratory in the United States. It might contain small quantities of element 43 as a result. The Italian physicist Emilio Segr&egrave; (1905- ), who had worked with Fermi, obtained a sample of the bombarded molybdenum and indeed obtained indications of the presence of element 43. It was the first new element to be manufactured by artificial means and was called &ldquo;technetium&rdquo; from the Greek word for &ldquo;artificial&rdquo;.</p></div> </div>
