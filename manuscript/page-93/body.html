When the uranium-235 nucleus (or plutonium-239 or uranium-233) undergoes fission, it breaks up into any of a large number of middle-sized nuclei that are radioactive&mdash;much more intensely radioactive than the original fuel. (It was from among these &ldquo;fission products&rdquo; that isotopes of element 61 were first obtained in 1945. Coming from the nuclear fire, it reminded its discoverers of Prometheus, who stole fire from the sun in the Greek myths, and so it was called &ldquo;promethium&rdquo;.)</p><p>145</p><p>The fission products still contain energy and some of them can be used in lightweight &ldquo;nuclear batteries&rdquo;. Such nuclear batteries were first built in 1954. Some batteries, using plutonium-238 rather than fission products, have been put to use in powering artificial satellites over long periods.</p></div> </div>
