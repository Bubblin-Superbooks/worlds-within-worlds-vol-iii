It would take gamma rays or cosmic particles with 1836 times as much energy to form the proton-antiproton pair as would suffice for the electron-positron pair. Cosmic particles of the necessary energies existed but they were rare and the chance of someone being present with a particle detector just as a rare super-energetic cosmic particle happened to form a proton-antiproton pair was very small.</p><p>The Bevatron began operation in 1954.</p><p>Physicists had to wait until they had succeeded in designing particle accelerators that would produce enough energy to allow the creation of proton-antiproton pairs. This came about in the early 1950s when a device called the &ldquo;Cosmotron&rdquo; was built at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Long Island in 1952 and another called the &ldquo;Bevatron&rdquo; at the University of California in Berkeley in 1954.</p></div> </div>
