Can we be witnessing such enormous mutual annihilation?</p><p>Indeed, it is not altogether inconceivable that we may still have new types of forces and new sources of energy to 164 discover. Until about 1900, no one suspected the existence of nuclear energy. Are we quite sure now that nuclear energy brings us to the end, and that there is not a form of energy more subtle still, and greater?</p><p>In 1962, for instance, certain puzzling objects called &ldquo;quasars&rdquo; were discovered far out in space, a billion light-years or more away from us.
