Indeed, it can be so designed to produce more plutonium-239 than the uranium-235 it uses up, so that you actually end up with more nuclear fuel than you started with. In this way, all the uranium on earth (and not just uranium-235) can be considered potential nuclear fuel.</p><p>The Shippingport Atomic Power Station, the first full-scale, nuclear-electric station built exclusively for civilian needs, provides electricity for the homes and factories of the greater Pittsburgh area. The pressurized-water reactor, which now has a 90,000-net-electrical-kilowatt capacity, began commercial operation in 1957. The reactor is in the large building in the center.</p></div> </div>
