<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There are a number of different ways in which a quantity of hydrogen can be heated to very high temperatures&mdash;through electric currents, through magnetic fields, through 154 laser beams and so on. As the temperature goes up into the tens of thousands of degrees, the hydrogen atoms (or any atoms) are broken up into free electrons and bare nuclei. Such a mixture of charged particles is called a &ldquo;plasma&rdquo;. Ever since physicists have begun to try to work with very hot gases, with fusion energy in mind, they have had to study the properties of such &ldquo;plasma&rdquo;, and a whole new science of &ldquo;plasma physics&rdquo; has come into existence.</p><p>But if you do heat a gas to very high temperatures, it will tend to expand and thin out to uselessness.</p></div> </div>
