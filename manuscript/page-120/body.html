<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> How can such a super-hot gas be confined in a fixed volume without an enormous gravitational field to hold it together?</p><p>An obvious answer would be to place it in a container, but no ordinary container of matter will serve to hold the hot gas. You may think this is because the temperature of the gas will simply melt or vaporize whatever matter encloses it. This is not so. Although the gas is at a very high temperature, it is so thin that it has very little total heat. It does not have enough heat to melt the solid walls of a container. What happens instead is that the hot plasma cools down the moment it touches the solid walls and the entire attempt to heat it is ruined.</p></div> </div>
