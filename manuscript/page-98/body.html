<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As it happens, though, nuclear fission is not the only route to useful nuclear energy.</p><p>Aston&rsquo;s studies in the 1920s had shown that it was the middle-sized nuclei that were most tightly packed. Energy would be given off if middle-sized nuclei were produced from either extreme. Not only would energy be formed by the breakup of particularly massive nuclei through fission, but also through the combination of small nuclei to form larger ones (&ldquo;nuclear fusion&rdquo;).</p><p>In fact, from Aston&rsquo;s studies it could be seen that, mass for mass, nuclear fusion would produce far more energy than nuclear fission. This was particularly true in the conversion of hydrogen to helium; that is, the conversion of the individual protons of 4 separate hydrogen nuclei into the 2-proton&mdash;2-neutron structure of the helium nucleus.</p></div> </div>
