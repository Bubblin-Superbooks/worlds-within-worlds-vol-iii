The brown briquets, slightly richer in uranium, were concentrated in the central area.

The number of uranium atoms undergoing fission each second rose and, finally, at 3:45 p.m., the uranium fission became self-sustaining. It kept going on its own (with the cadmium rods ready to be pushed in if it looked as though it were getting out of hand&mdash;something calculations showed was not likely).</p><p>News of this success was announced to Washington by a cautious telephone call from Arthur Holly Compton (1892-1962) to James Bryant Conant (1893- ). &ldquo;The Italian navigator has landed in the new world&rdquo;, said Compton. Conant asked, &ldquo;How were the natives?&rdquo;, and the answer was, &ldquo;Very friendly&rdquo;.</p></div> </div>
