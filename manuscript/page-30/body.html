<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The actual discovery of the element plutonium came the year before, however, when neptunium-238 was formed. It emitted a beta particle and became plutonium-238, an isotope that was radioactive enough to be easily detected and identified by Glenn Theodore Seaborg (1912- ), and his co-workers, who completed McMillan&rsquo;s experiments when he was called away to other defense research.</p><p>Neptunium and plutonium were the first &ldquo;transuranium elements&rdquo; to be produced in the laboratory, but they weren&rsquo;t the last. Over the next 30 years, isotopes were formed that contained more and more protons in the nucleus and therefore had higher and higher atomic numbers. At the moment of writing, isotopes of every element up to and including element 105 have been formed.</p></div> </div>
