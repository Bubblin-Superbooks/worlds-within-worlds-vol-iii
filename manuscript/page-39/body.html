<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>If the radioactive isotopes included radium, that was conceivable. Radium had an atomic number of 88, only four less than uranium&rsquo;s 92. You could imagine that a neutron being absorbed by a uranium nucleus might make the latter 125 so unstable as to cause it to emit 2 alpha particles and become radium. Barium, however, had an atomic number of 56, only a little over half that of uranium. How could a uranium nucleus be made to turn into a barium nucleus unless it more or less broke in half? Nothing like that had ever been observed before and Hahn hesitated to suggest it.</p><p>While he was nerving himself to do so, however, Lise Meitner, in Stockholm, receiving reports of what was being done in Hahn&rsquo;s laboratory and thinking about it, decided that unheard-of or not, there was only one explanation. The uranium nucleus was breaking in half.</p></div> </div>
