It had an ordinary half-life (for a radioactive change in which it gave off alpha particles) of 24,300 years, which is long enough to make it easy to handle.</p><p>But how can plutonium-239 be formed in sufficient quantities to be useful? After all, it doesn&rsquo;t occur in nature. Surprisingly, that turned out to be easy. Uranium-238 atoms 143 will absorb many of the neutrons that are constantly leaking out of the reactor and will become first neptunium-239 and then plutonium-239. The plutonium, being a different element from the uranium, can be separated from uranium and obtained in useful quantities.</p></div> </div>
