<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It seems ideal, but there is a catch. However clear the theory, before a fusion power station can be established some practical method must be found to start the fusion process, which means finding some way for attaining temperatures in the millions of degrees.</p><p>One method for obtaining the necessary temperature was known by 1945. An exploding fission bomb would do it. If, somehow, the necessary hydrogen-2 was combined with a fission bomb, the explosion would set off a fusion reaction that would greatly multiply the energy released. You would have in effect a &ldquo;thermonuclear bomb&rdquo;. (To the general public, this was commonly known as a &ldquo;hydrogen bomb&rdquo; or an &ldquo;H-bomb&rdquo;.)</p></div> </div>
