<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One method for obtaining the necessary temperature was known by 1945. An exploding fission bomb would do it. If, somehow, the necessary hydrogen-2 was combined with a fission bomb, the explosion would set off a fusion reaction that would greatly multiply the energy released. You would have in effect a &ldquo;thermonuclear bomb&rdquo;. (To the general public, this was commonly known as a &ldquo;hydrogen bomb&rdquo; or an &ldquo;H-bomb&rdquo;.)</p><p>In 1952 the first fusion device was exploded by the United States in the Marshall Islands. Within months, the Soviet Union had exploded one of its own and in time thermonuclear bombs thousands of times as powerful as the first fission bomb over Hiroshima were built and exploded.</p></div> </div>
