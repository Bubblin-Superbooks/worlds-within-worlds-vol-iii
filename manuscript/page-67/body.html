In this way uranium-238 actually interfered with the chain reaction.</p><p>In any quantity of uranium, the more uranium-235 present and the less uranium-238, the more easily the chain reaction would proceed and the lower the critical size needed. Vast efforts were therefore made to separate the 2 135 isotopes and prepare uranium with a higher than normal concentration of uranium-235 (&ldquo;enriched uranium&rdquo;).</p><p>Of course, there was no great desire for a fearful explosion to get out of hand while the chain reaction was being studied. Before any bomb could be constructed, the mechanism of the chain reaction would have to be studied.</p></div> </div>
