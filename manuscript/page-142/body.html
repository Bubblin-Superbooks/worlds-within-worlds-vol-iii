<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>If antimatter were available to us, and if we could control the manner in which it united with matter, we would have a source of energy much greater and, perhaps, simpler to produce than would be involved in hydrogen fusion.</p><p>To be sure, there is no antimatter on earth, except for the submicroscopic amounts that are formed by the input of tremendous energies. Nor does anyone know of any conceivable way of forming antimatter at less energy than that produced by mutual annihilation, so that we might say that mankind can never make an energy profit out of it&mdash;except that with the memory of Rutherford&rsquo;s prediction that nuclear energy of any kind could never be tapped, one hesitates to be pessimistic about anything.</p></div> </div>
