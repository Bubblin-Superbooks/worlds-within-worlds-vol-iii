<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The Table of Contents in each volume contains relative hyperlinks to pages in all three volumes of Worlds Within Worlds:</p><p>These links function correctly if the books are read online, and can be made to work for books installed on a local drive or a website. (EBook-reader formats like ePub or Mobi do not support links between eBooks.)</p><p>To install these books in another file system, create a directory (called localbooks in the example). Within that directory, create a subdirectory for each eBook, as in this outline view:</p><p>localbooks/ 40000/ 40000-h/ 40000-h.htm images/ ... 40001/ 40001-h/ 40001-h.htm images/ ... ...</p></div> </div>
