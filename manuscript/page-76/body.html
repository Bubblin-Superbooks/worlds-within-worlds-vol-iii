<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This was the day and moment when the world entered the &ldquo;nuclear age&rdquo;. For the first time, mankind had constructed a device in which the nuclear energy being given off was greater than the energy poured in. Mankind had tapped the reservoirs of nuclear energy and could put it to use. Had Rutherford lived but 6 more years, he would have seen how wrong he was to think it could never be done.</p><p>The people of earth remained unaware of what had taken place in Chicago and physicists continued to work toward the development of the nuclear bomb.</p><p>Enriched uranium was successfully prepared. Critical sizes were brought low enough to make a nuclear bomb small enough to be carried by plane to some target. Suppose one had 2 slabs of enriched uranium, each below critical size, but which were above critical size if combined.</p></div> </div>
