<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In the course of the last four months it has been made probable&mdash;through the work of Joliot in France as well as Fermi and Szilard in America&mdash;that it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium, by which vast amounts of power and large quantities of new radium-like elements would be generated. Now it appears almost certain that this could be achieved in the immediate future.</p><p>This new phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs, and it is conceivable&mdash;though much less certain&mdash;that extremely powerful bombs of a new type may thus be constructed. A single bomb of this type, carried by boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory. However, such bombs might very well prove to be too heavy for transportation by air.</p></div> </div>
