<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In 1934 Enrico Fermi began his first experiments involving the bombardment of uranium with neutrons&mdash;experiments that were to change the face of the world.</p><p>Fermi had found that slow neutrons, which had very little energy, were easily absorbed by atomic nuclei&mdash;more easily than fast neutrons were absorbed, and certainly more easily than charged particles were.</p><p>Often what happened was that the neutron was simply absorbed by the nucleus. Since the neutron has a mass number of 1 and an atomic number of 0 (because it is uncharged), a nucleus that absorbs a neutron remains an isotope of the same element, but increases its mass number.</p></div> </div>
