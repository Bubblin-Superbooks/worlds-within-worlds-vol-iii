<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>However effective a fusion bomb may be in liberating vast quantities of energy, it is not what one has in mind when 151 speaking of a fusion power station. The energy of a fusion bomb is released all at once and its only function is that of utter destruction. What is wanted is the production of fusion energy at a low and steady rate&mdash;a rate that is under the control of human operators.</p><p>The sun, for instance, is a vast fusion furnace 866,000 miles across, but it is a controlled one&mdash;even though that control is exerted by the impersonal laws of nature. It releases energy at a very steady and very slow rate. (The rate is not slow in human terms, of course, but stars sometimes do release their energy in a much more cataclysmic fashion.</p></div> </div>
