Blocks of graphite containing uranium metal and uranium oxide were piled up in huge quantities (enriched uranium was not yet available) in order to approach critical size. This took place under the stands of a football stadium at the University of Chicago, with Enrico Fermi (who had come to the United States in 1938) in charge.</p><p>The large structure was called an &ldquo;atomic pile&rdquo; at first because of the blocks of graphite being piled up. The proper name for such a device, and the one that was eventually adopted, was, however, &ldquo;nuclear reactor&rdquo;.</p></div> </div>
