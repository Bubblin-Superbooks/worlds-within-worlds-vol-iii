<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A positron, however, does not endure long after formation. All about it were atoms containing electrons. It could not move for more than a millionth of a second or so before it encountered one of those electrons. When it did, there was an attraction between the two, since they were of opposite electric charge. Briefly they might circle each other (to form a combination called &ldquo;positronium&rdquo;) but only very briefly. Then they collided and, since they were opposites, each cancelled the other.</p><p>The process whereby an electron and a positron met and cancelled is called &ldquo;mutual annihilation&rdquo;. Not everything was gone, though. The mass, in disappearing, was converted into the equivalent amount of energy, which made its appearance in the form of one or more gamma rays.</p></div> </div>
