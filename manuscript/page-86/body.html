<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The world appeared to have far greater sources of energy than had been expected. The &ldquo;fossil fuels&rdquo;&mdash;coal, oil and natural gas&mdash;were being used at such a rate that many speculated that the gas and oil would be gone in decades and the coal in centuries. Was it possible that uranium might now serve as a new source that would last indefinitely?</p><p>It was rather disappointing that it was uranium-235 which underwent fission, because that isotope made up only 0.7% of the uranium that existed. If uranium-235 were all we had and all we ever could have, the energy supply of the world would still be rather too limited.</p></div> </div>
