It came to be called the &ldquo;pinch effect&rdquo; because the magnetic field pinched the gas together and held it in place.</p><p>The first attempt to make use of the pinch effect for confining plasma, with eventual ignition of fusion in mind, was in 1951 by the English physicist Alan Alfred Ware (1924- ). Other physicists followed, not only in Great Britain, but in the United States and the Soviet Union as well.</p></div> </div>
